# Survival Squared
## Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/ojWTxJPYB9c>
## Description:

<br>

## What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
<br>

I'm thinking about designing a small video game. A little wave survival where you start with a dot and get weapons, which you will use to kill the dangerous squares who are coming to get you.

<br>

#### Features needed:

- Player dot with WASD movements and mouse for aiming
- A timer and wave counter
- Enemy squares who will kill the player if they touch them
- Kill counter
- Leaderboard of attempts
- Scaling difficulty with waves



## What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
<br>

I'm gonna need to research a python package to make the graphics and everything related to it, currently I choose pygame.

<br>

## What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
<br>

My best outcome is having all the features I wrote in features needed, a better one is having most of them and a good one is having a functional game otherwise, I can't submit it in whatever state it is.

## Timeline - 06/12/2022 to 20/12/2022 (Est. 14 days) 

### 06/12/2022

I wrote the readme until this point and messed around with pygame code, looking at the documentation, pygame tutorials and in stackoverflow when I couldn't make something work as expected.

### 07/12/2022

Today with the knowledge acquired yesterday, I wanted to make a dot which would represent the main player, and make it move, but not in a speed that was tied to framerate, I wanted to make it move at the same speed indifferently if the framerate was 60, 120 or 24. After much tinkering, I renembered reading a lot of posts about games that had their physics tied to framerate and csgo/pubg which had tick rates, which meant they would only update a certain amount of times per second.

So started accumulating the ticks in delta, and if the delta was higher then 25, which means 25 ms had passed, I would check for keyboard inputs on the WASD keys and move it accordingly with my speed variable.

Without counting the bad design which makes speed higher when going diagonally it seems to move, even if the framerate was different.

After further testing if the framerate goes low enough it will slow down, hmmmmmmm, dammit

On my quest to make it move constant with time and not framerate, I also built some debug data to help me understand.

- Current framerate(max framerate with arrows keys adjustments)
- Time to render a frame
- Dot X position
- Dot Y Position

After some research into diagonal movement I made the keyboard inputs change a list with 2 values and if the keys are the diagonal keys, I made the x and y multiplied by 0.7071, because after looking for a way to calculate the speed that I needed to go diagonally I found a calculation that was c = root(x^2 + y^2) then divided by 2 gave me the speed for x and y, then I calculated the percentage of that compared with 5 and came up with 0.7071. 

Since then I read more about vectors and found a way to calculate the distance that the previous equation gave me, then divided by two gave me the correct speed.

Speed was 5 here.

### 08/12/2022

Made class for the debug text, it's kinda bad but does the job for now 

![debug_text](progress-pics/Screenshot%202022-12-09%20145521.png)

Also made F3 show the debug info and F4 hide it.

### 09/12/2022

Made a class for the player, also made it a circle so the name of the game makes sense "Survival Squared", right now I need to make the enemies, the squares, and implement a basic hunt AI, where they come after the player, if they can reach it, player dies and "Game Over!"

![player circle](progress-pics/Screenshot%20_player.png)


After that I created a child Class of the player called Square, then gave it a random movement method.

Back in Main, I created a list of squares, made them call the random direction method once a second, and updated their movement every 25 ms like the player, here's the result

Some
![Some squares](progress-pics/Screenshot_squares.png)

5000 of them

### 11/12/2022

Today I started by doing a new method for the squares to seek the players after that worked, I created a method for collisions between squares, at first it wasn't working right, but then I made it take a list of all the squares check if it's not the same by checking coordinates, and if not change their mov vector away from the colliding square.

![Squares chasing](progress-pics/Screenshot_20221211_032920.png)

I was testing different squares with different speeds and different collisions, as the blue ones didnt collide but any squares that they passed by collided, so they looked like they took them along

Next up probably need to make a gun for the player, need to look into pygame.mouse and genertate bullets when player clicks mouse, that will go on the direction the mouse was in.

### 12/12/2022

Moved the collision function out of classes, smoothed the movement of squares towards the player by giving margin on movements so they don't wobble. Reworked collisions so they don't add new speed unless explicitly  by the multiplier

Creating bullets, first I could spawn them but they didn't move

![Not Moving](progress-pics/Screenshot_20221212_062048.png)

Then I was able to make them move after staring a "thousand hours", into this page https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/math.html#pygame.math.Vector2, 

![Bullets!!!](progress-pics/Screenshot%20(8).png)

They're Moving! (Already working as intended here)

But I couldn't make them go anywhere else but 90 degrees, as into the right or bottom because pygame.mouse.get_pos() got it's position relative to the start of the window 0,0. So I had to  calculate it relative to the player's location first I tried the player's location minus the mouse but that made them shoot backwards, then mouse location minus the player and voila it worked! EUREKA!

### 13/13/2022

After creating the bullets movement towards the mouse current position, I knew I had to make it for the enemy squares, after having some trouble with the function I created for the bullets, because I forgot I need relative positions between the squares and the player and not grid positions, I was able to make them move towards the player, so smoooooth!


Added walls but the purple squares kept getting stuck in the corners, tried making circles, but they don't havea round collision. Altered the speed vector after collisions to reduce the max speed a bit. Seems to be working most of the time.

### 14/14/2022


Decided the next step was waves, added that and an endgame, after going through the waves, the player receives a screen congratulating them, if they die, they go back a wave. Also added a hint to hit space to start game.

#### Features needed:

- Player dot with WASD movements and mouse for aiming       (V)
- Enemy squares who will kill the player if they touch them (V)
- Scaling difficulty with waves                             (V)


### 15/12/2022

Today I worked a bit on adding a timer, wave counter and kill/death counter, which I show automatically while playing and show it again at the end for the player to see how they fared.

- A timer and wave counter                                  (V)
- Kill counter                                              (V)

Now I'm gonna build the test_project.py and I said I was gonna implement  a "- Leaderboard of attempts" but I feel like moving on from the project and I really feel like I accomplished what I set out to do with this current implementation.

Final Presentation

Worked on the test_project.py, looks good enough. I think that's it, going to record a video for the project
